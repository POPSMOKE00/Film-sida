        <h3>Filming</h3>
        <p>Professional safecracker John Bridger's team is set to steal $35 million worth of gold bullion from a safe in
            Venice from Italian gangsters who had stolen it weeks earlier. Professional fixer Charlie Croker, computer
            expert Lyle or "Napster", wheelman Handsome Rob, inside man Steve, and explosives expert Left Ear comprise
            the team. Although the heist is successful, Steve double-crosses them as they drive towards Austria with the
            bullion. With another crew he takes it for himself and kills John. Rob drives the van over the bridge into
            the water to protect the others, using air tanks from the heist to stay alive. Steve leaves them for dead.
            A year later in Philadelphia, Charlie finds Steve, under a new identity and is laundering the gold through
            Ukrainian jeweler Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also
            recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe expert, offering her the chance to avenge her
            father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguised as a cable technician, maps out its
            interior and determines the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion.
            Unaware of Stella's identity, Steve asks her out on a date. The plan is to blow the safe while Steve is away
            on his supposed date, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion.
            Supplier Skinny Pete gets the explosives and mechanic Wrench modifies the cars.</p>
